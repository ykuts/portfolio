                    <h3>Nice to meet you -</h3>
                    <p>My name is Yuliia and this is my story...</p>
                    <div class="text__about">
                        <p>I am a young cheerful girl who finds joy in the simple pleasures of life.</p>
                        <p>My passion for traveling has taken me to amazing parts of the world where
                            I am immersed in different cultures and enjoy the beauty of diversity.</p>
                        <p>When I'm not exploring new places, I love to do handmade crafts.
                            There is something incredibly enjoyable about creating something
                            with your own hands. Whether it's a piece of jewelry or an interior piece,
                            the process of creating brings me a sense of fulfillment and peace.</p>
                        <p>I believe that life is an adventure and I am always interested in discovering new places,
                            meeting interesting people and discovering the beauty of the unknown.</p>
                        <p>Join me on this journey where every day is an opportunity to explore,
                            create and enjoy the miracles of life.</p>
